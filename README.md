# Lazy_Evaluation_in_Python
Trying to understand "Lazy Evaluation" in Functional programming for a research paper, comparing process speed with non-Lazy functions

Wikipedia: In programming language theory, lazy evaluation, or call-by-need 
is an evaluation strategy which delays the evaluation of an expression
until its value is needed and which also avoids repeated evaluations.
