''' sys.getsizeof(object[, default])

Return the size of an object in bytes. The object can be any type of
object. All built-in objects will return correct results, but this
does not have to hold true for third-party extensions as it is
implementation specific.Only the memory consumption directly attributed
to the object is accounted for, not the memory consumption of objects it refers to.'''
